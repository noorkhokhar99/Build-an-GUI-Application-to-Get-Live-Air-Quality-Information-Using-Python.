# Build-an-GUI-Application-to-Get-Live-Air-Quality-Information-Using-Python.


We are living in a modernization and industrialization era. Our life becomes more and more convenient. But the problem is Air Pollution arise with time. This Pollution makes us unhealthy, Air is a Lifeline for our life.

In this article, we are going to write python scripts to get live air quality information and bind it with GUI Application.
